# Melbourne Housing Predition

## Main Objective: To create a model able to predict the Housing Prices in Melbourne.
1) Fetch the Housing Prices Dataset
2) Data cleaning i.e A) Remove insignificant features , B) Deal with N.A values and drop the rest unimportant data records.
3) Train Test Split
4) Determine the best fit for our model
5) Predictions

## CONCLUSION :
Thus, I got best R2 score for Ridge Regression among other models for my Melbourne Housing Prediction Model. Moreover I to optimize my predictions I used RidgeCV that calculated the optimal alpha(alpha = 5.0) for this particular case along with Cross Validation. Currently my R2 score is 0.6743855819360092(i.e. 67.44% accuracy).

## FLAWS : 
For now I have just filled the Null values with 0 or their mean values but need to find the most accurate assumrd value. Also I have </b>not considered Feature Transformation.</b>
Thus, for increasing my accuracy I need to overcome my flaws and also test other predictive models ANOVA, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks


### NOTE : My analysis report, code and the dataset are also added to the same github repository.
